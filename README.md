# 2048 Game using Python Tkinter 🕹️

**📌 Overview**

The 2048 Game is a sliding puzzle game where players combine tiles with the same number to reach the 2048 tile. This Python-based version is built using Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and follows the original game mechanics.

**🛠 Features**

✅ Intuitive Grid-Based Gameplay – Uses a 4×4 grid for tile movements and merging.
✅ Smooth Animations & GUI – Implemented using Tkinter for a clean and user-friendly interface.
✅ Arrow Key Controls – Players can move tiles (Up, Down, Left, Right) using keyboard inputs.
✅ Random Tile Generation – New tiles (2 or 4) appear after each move.
✅ Game Over Detection – Displays a message when no moves are left.
✅ Winning Condition – The game announces victory when the 2048 tile is reached.
✅ Scoring System – Keeps track of the player's score.

**🎮 How to Play?**

Use Arrow Keys (←, →, ↑, ↓) to move tiles.
Tiles with the same number merge when they collide.
The goal is to create the 2048 tile by merging smaller ones.
If no moves are possible, the game ends.
📌 Technologies Used
🔹 Python – Core logic and game mechanics
🔹 Tkinter – GUI design and event handling
🔹 Random Module – Generates new tiles dynamically
